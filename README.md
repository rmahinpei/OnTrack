# OnTrack
## Purpose
The constant business of the world leads many individual neglect and sacrifice their own personal health, which can result in long-term adverse effects on the individual. To break this cycle and encourage more individuals to stay on top of their physical health, OnTrack was created, an interactive program allowing users to track their caloric intake and physical activity.

## Key Features
OnTrack allows the user to track their:
- Food (caloric) intake
- Physical activity
- Water intake

OnTrack also allows the user to see their "current" progress by showing all their logs leading up to that point as well. At the end of the day, OnTrack also enables the user to tally their "totals" for the day.

To learn more about the program and its usage, feel free to watch this [demo video](https://youtu.be/ySRz24RFVrE).

## How to Contribute
Here are just a few ways that interested individuals can contribute to this project:
- Add more tracking features for the user to use
- Enable data to be written and loaded from file
- Allow users to make accounts
